# acid_base_calculator
 This is a simple python code wherein it calculate all the values and turn it into a graph of the titration curve. Do note that it can't calculate pH for polyprotic acids and bases and also it can't calculate multicomponent systems.
  
How to use:
1. if prompted this question "What is your analyte?", type your analyte because this will show in the graph as part of the title and as label in the x-axis.
2. Next, choose the type of solution your analyte is. it can only choose between acid and base, so only type between these two. Also, type it in lowercase.
3. Choose between strong and weak(also must be in lowercase). This is done because strong and weak electrolytes have different computations.
4. Put all values when prompted and just wait for the titration curve to show.
